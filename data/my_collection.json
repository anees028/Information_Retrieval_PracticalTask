        "raw_text": "released to the general public is usually numbered 10th edition, as that is approximately how many we go through to get it in the form we find acceptable for general release.  Any editions which have numbers less than 10 should be replaced.  Most editions are going to be updated in March, 1992, so look to replace yours.  \"Version\" is used to mark separate books being put into etext in which case we have used a very different paper book, sometimes a different translation, etc.  Versions are labeled by a different name:  aesop10 was our first version of Aesop's Fables. name:  aesop11 is going to be the eleventh edition of this etext. name:  aesopa10 is the second version of Aesop's Fables. name:  aesopa11 is going to be the eleventh edition of that.  Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)  The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000x100,000,000 = Trillion] This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers.  We need your donations more than ever!  All donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/IBC\", and are tax deductible to the extent allowable by law (\"IBC\" is Illinois Benedictine College).

You know: lawyers. They tell us that we could get sued if there is something wrong with your copy of this etext, even if what's wrong is not our fault, and even if you got it for free and from someone other than us.  So, among other things, this \"small print\" statement disclaims most of the liability we could have to you if some- thing is wrong with your copy.  This \"small print\" statement also tells you how to distribute copies of this etext if you want to.  As explained in greater detail below, if you distribute such copies you may be required to pay us if you distribute using our trademark, and if we get sued in connection with your distribution.  *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT  By using or reading any part of the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext that follows this statement, you indicate that you agree to and accept the following terms, conditions and disclaimers.  If you do not understand them, or do not agree to and accept them, then [1] you may not read or use the etext, and [2] you will receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it on request within 30 days of receiving it.  If you received this etext on a physical medium (such as a disk), you must return the physical medium with your request and retain no copies of it.  ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS  This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts, is a \"Public Domain\" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the \"Project\").  Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying royalties.  Special rules, set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext under the Project's \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark.  To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any medium they may be on may contain errors and defects (collectively, the \"Defects\").  Among other things, such Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, unauthorized distribution of a work that is not in the public domain, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.  DISCLAIMER  As to every real and alleged Defect in this etext and any medium it may be on, and but for the \"Right of Replacement or Refund\" described below, [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) dis- claims all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLI- GENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND  If you received this etext in a physical medium, and the medium was physically damaged when you received it, you may return it within 90 days of receiving it to the person from whom you received it with a note explaining such Defects.  Such person will give you, in his or its discretion, a replacement copy of the etext or a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it.  If you received it electronically and it is incomplete, inaccu- rate or corrupt, you may send notice within 90 days of receiving it to the person from whom you received it describing such Defects.  Such person will give you, in his or its discretion, a second opportunity to receive it electronically, or a refund of the money (if any) you paid to receive it.  Aside from this limited warranty, THIS ETEXT IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS-IS\".  NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the above disclaimers, exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.  This \"small print\" statement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights.  IF YOU DISTRIBUTE THIS ETEXT  You agree that if you distribute this etext or a copy of it to anyone, you will indemnify and hold the Project, its officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost and ex- pense, including legal fees, that arise by reason of your distribution and either a Defect in the etext, or any alter- ation, modification or addition to the etext by you or for which you are responsible.  This provision applies to every distribu- tion of this etext by you, whether or not for profit or under the \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark.  DISTRIBUTION UNDER \"PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm\"  You agree that if you distribute one or more copies of this etext under the \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark (whether electron- ically, or by disk, book or any other medium), you will:  [1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this re- quires that you do not remove, alter or modify the etext or this \"small print!\" statement.  You may however, if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form, including any form resulting from conversion by word processing or hyper- text software, but only so long as *EITHER*:  [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable.  We consider an etext *not* clearly readable if it contains characters other than those intended by the author of the work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may be used to convey punctuation intended by the author, and additional characters may be used to indicate hypertext links.  [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no expense into in plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form by the program that displays the etext (as is the case, for instance, with most word processors).  [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC or other equivalent proprietary form).  [2]  Honor the terms and conditions applicable to distributors under the \"RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND\" set forth above.  [3]  Pay a trademark license fee of 20% (twenty percent) of the net profits you derive from distributing this etext under the trademark, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices.  The license fee:  [*]  Is required only if you derive such profits.  In distributing under our trademark, you incur no obligation to charge money or earn profits for your distribution.  [*]  Shall be paid to \"Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois Benedictine College\" (or to such other person as the Project Gutenberg Association may direct) within the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare) your year-end federal income tax return with respect to your profits for that year.  WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?  The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time, scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution you can think of.  Money should be paid to \"Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois Benedictine College\".  Drafted by CHARLES B.

When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life.\"  No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night.  \"You will want some refreshment after our long journey,\" said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room.  There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice.  Suddenly they heard growling and barking. \"What is that?\" said the Country Mouse.  \"It is only the dogs of the house,\" answered the other.  \"Only!\" said the Country Mouse. \"I do not like that music at my dinner.\"  Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run off.  \"Good-bye, Cousin,\" said the Country Mouse, \"What! going so soon?\" said the other.  \"Yes,\" he replied;  \"Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear.\"",

The Frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their midst, and all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster; but after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two of the boldest of them ventured out towards the Log, and even dared to touch it; still it did not move.  Then the greatest hero of the Frogs jumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and down upon it, thereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for some time the Frogs went about their business every day without taking the slightest notice of their new King Log lying in their midst. But this did not suit them, so they sent another petition to Jove, and said to him, \"We want a real king; one that will really rule over us.\"  Now this made Jove angry, so he sent among them a big Stork that soon set to work gobbling them all up.  Then the Frogs repented when too late.  Better no rule than cruel rule.",

As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain.  He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog.  Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live.  But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days.  The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena.  Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim.  But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog.  The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story.  Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest.

He rushed down towards the village calling out \"Wolf, Wolf,\" and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time.  This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out \"Wolf, Wolf,\" still louder than before.  But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help.  So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy's flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said:  \"A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.\"",

But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: \"See that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides.\"  So the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the other: \"Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along.\"  Well, the Man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his Boy up before him on the Donkey.  By this time they had come to the town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them.  The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at.  The men said: \"Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking son?\"  The Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do.  They thought and they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders.  They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole.  In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore-feet being tied together he was drowned.  \"That will teach you,\" said an old man who had followed them:  \"Please all, and you will please none.\"",

The bull replied: \"I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you want.\"  The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it.  The ram, he felt sure, was the proper friend to apply to.  So she went to the ram and told him the case.  The ram replied: \"Another time, my dear friend.  I do not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares.\"  The Hare then applied, as a last hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older persons than himself had declined the task.  By this time the hounds were quite near, and the Hare took to her heels and luckily escaped.  He that has many friends, has no friends.",
